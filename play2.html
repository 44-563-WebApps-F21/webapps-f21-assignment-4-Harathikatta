        <h6 class="Goring">LORD GORING.</h6><p class="speech"> Life is never fair, Robert.  And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.</p>
        
        <h6 class="Robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p class="speech"> Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons.  What this century worships is wealth.  The God of this century is wealth.  To succeed one must have wealth.  At all costs one must have wealth.</p>
        
        <h6 class="Goring">LORD GORING.</h6><p class="speech"> You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well.</p>
        
        <h6 class="Robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p class="speech"> When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time for success.  I couldnâ€™t wait.</p>
        
        <h6 class="Goring">LORD GORING.</h6><p class="speech"> Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?</p>

        <h6 class="Robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p class="speech"> I did not sell myself for money. I bought success at a great price.  That is all.</p>
